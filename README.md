This project involves creating and managing a basic Employee and Department 
Management System using SQL. The project aims to help students understand how to design 
databases, insert records, and manage relationships between tables. Students will create two 
tables—Employees and Departments—populate them with data, and execute various INSERT 
queries based on real-world scenarios. Through this project, students will learn how to efficiently 
handle data and simulate operations in an organizational setup.# Project-With-SQL
